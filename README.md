This is an attempt at a [Meteor][]-based web application that connects
mentors with noobs.

The directory structure is based on the one recommended in Coleman
and Greif's [Discover Meteor][].

## Quick Start

First, get [node][] v0.10 if you don't already have it.

Then install meteor if you don't already have it by running
`sudo curl https://install.meteor.com | sh`.

Then install [meteorite][], the smart package manager for Meteor,
by running `npm install -g meteorite`.

Then enter the repository directory, run `mrt`, and visit
http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

  [Meteor]: http://meteor.com
  [Discover Meteor]: https://www.discovermeteor.com/
  [node]: http://nodejs.org
  [meteorite]: https://npmjs.org/package/meteorite
